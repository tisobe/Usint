- In general, hitting <enter> after inputting value into any field results 
in being redirected to the login page. I tend to do this a lot out of a habit 
and I suspect that other users do it as well.

            ---- Use of return key is disabled.

(1) http://r2d2-v.cfa.harvard.edu/rm_submission/

- "The obserbation is not approved yet." -> does it meant not approved for flight? or not "verified by"?

            ---- Only when the observation is approved, you cannot cancel the submission. 
                 You can cancel "verified by", too, if you are the submitter. 

(2) http://r2d2-v.cfa.harvard.edu/orupdate/

- When I click "Display verified", I get a table that has one empty column (the second one from the right) 
  - it originally contained the "Update" button. Is there a way to get rid of this column from the table?

            ---- I implemented a new design.

- Selecting POC ID: I would expect that the table will only show entries belonging to this POC, instead 
entries belonging to this POC are displayed first and are followed with all the other entries. This 
is a bit confusing if one wants to search for their own entries and expects to see only a few.

            ---- This is by design. At the last update, the users wanted to bubble up their entries but
                 also wanted to  see others. 

- Is it allowed that I verify submissions that were submitted by someone else? 
I have just managed to do this.

            ---  This is by design; just in a case, the POC in the responsibility is not around
                for a quick approval (e.g. too/ddt), someone can step in.


(3) http://r2d2-v.cfa.harvard.edu/chkupdata/19497.002/

- In case of observations approved 'AS IS', there is (obviously) no Modified parameters section. 
Still, maybe we could add an info saying that the observation was approved AS IS, for completeness?

            --- Added

- Parameter check page displays Submitted date as, e.g., Nov 008 2016. Why 008?

            --- Corrected

- It would be helpful to have a legend explaining the meaning of colors used in Parameter check page 
(green, magenta, yellow, etc.)

            --- Added

(4) Express approval page:

- When I place the cursor in "Please type obsids" box the text does not disapear 
  and has to be deleted manually

            ---- Removed the "Please..."

- Please type obsids: I entered a random text (not a obsid number) and was still 
taken to the next page that showed an empty table. Is there a way to validating the entered 
value before redirecting?

            ---- Added a notification informs the wrong format input

- I typed obsid=1, and I was still able to approve it. It then showed up in Target Parameter 
Update form with a note "Already in approved list". Is this a desired procedure? I would think 
we would like to detect and ignore observations that have already been already archived/approved? 
I also found obsid=1 on the Approved list with today's date.

            ---- There is the mechanism to do this. Unfortunately, obsid=1 is an old observation
                 and it was removed from the approved list; so the script thinks that it is not
                 approved yet. try obsid=19890.
                 Because this is an express approval, it does not check whether the obsids are
                 in the current possible observation list. 

Admin page

(5) Once in Django Administration, I could not find an easy way to go back to http://r2d2-v.cfa.harvard.edu/ocatmain/ 
and I used back arrow, which caused some problems:

            ---- This is by design. Two pages are supposed to be totally separate.
                 In normal case, only "cus" can use admin page, and "cus" are not a real "POC" 
                 and "cus" should not do anything on "ocatmain" side.
                

(6) I wanted to sign up myself for more duty periods (beyond March 2017), but my name was missing 
from the drop down menu. I checked and I was a member of only the USINT group. I added myself 
to the POC group, used back arrow to get back to the page with duty sign up form. 
I still could not see my name in the drop down menu. It appeared only when I reloaded the page.

            ---- This is because django design. The page needs to be reloaded before any changes take effect.
                 the reloading forces to read the updated database.

(7) Then I tried to sign up someone else and I was able to sign up Takashi. I clicked 'unlock' 
button in the line with the new record, expecting to be able to edit it. Instead, it disappeared.

            ---- This is by design. if you unlock, the entry is removed from the database and
                 go back to the original blank entry.

(8) I was not able to add TBD (no new record showed up in the table), but later on I found out 
that the TBD entry was actually added to the database, it was visible in Django Administration 
in Home # Schedule_submitter # Schedules.

            --- By design, TBD does not show up on the page. On surface, it is same as <blank>.
                TBD has a slightly different meaning in the database/scripts and I need to keep it as
                an option in the pulldown.

(9) Choosing 'unlock' next to existing records results in no action. I would expect to be able to edit them.

            --- See (7)

(10) Approved page: I was able to change Obsid=19497 to an invalid value of 19497777. Then I was 
able to change date to "11/08/16fwef".

            ---- You can do anything you want as an admin (cus). That is why only "cus" has the privilege.

(11) I spotted a few typos:

http://r2d2-v.cfa.harvard.edu/rm_submission/

- obserbation -> observation
- remvoed -> removed

http://r2d2-v.cfa.harvard.edu/orupdate/

- "Dislay Data for the Last 30 Days" -> Display
- "Dislay All Verified Cases" -> Display

- "Paramter check page" -> Parameter

- Express approval page:  indivisually -> individually
