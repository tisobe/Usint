I am still working on Schedule Submitter

1. Updating schedule with modified data span (e.g. changed starting data)
   needs farther testing.

2. Overlapped update (e.g., one period ending happens after the next starting time),
   needs to be tested. This should automatically modify the adjuscent period(s)
    --- overlapped case does not remove the extra entry yet

3. Updating may mess up user names, especially with TBD cases

4. TBD user name should not appear beyound the last offically signed up period
        --- too many TBD show up after the last correct entry after overlap case is
            removed (or try to remove)

5. Unlocking is not tested at all

6. warning display is not implemented yet. Preferably use javascript popup page

7. color coding is not implemented yet.
        * closed/signed up/open
        * none-standard period finishing/starting 
        * problem entries

8. speed seems very slow. try to improve coding

9. some of the functions are too long. devide them into smaller functions

Ocat Data Page:
1. Add dither submission. 
    Email from Jean (Sep 30, 2015)
    ------------------------------
    For ocatdata2html, it recently came up that Brad accidentally
    submitted a dither request in degrees when the form expected
    arcseconds. I wonder if it might make sense for the form to complain
    on non-zero dither amplitude values less than .1 arcsec.
