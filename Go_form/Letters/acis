In order to ensure the success of your program, your
participation in the planning process is essential.  Please review
your instrumental setup as it appears in our data base and confirm it,
or request changes, by reply email to me, no later than #deadline#.

You may link to your current observational setup by going to the
following URL:

http://cda.cfa.harvard.edu/chaser/startViewer.do?obsid=#obsid#   
(note the new location)

When the page loads, go to the left column and click on "Details". 
Please review all the entries, except for the SI_Mode.

Alternatively, you may search the OCAT by going to

http://cda.cfa.harvard.edu/chaser/mainEntry.do

Enter your obsid or other search criteria.  After the search, "select
all" and choose "view observation information".

When reviewing your setup, please consider the several important
issues discussed below.

In particular:
    * the target name,
    * the exposure time (in kilo-seconds),
    * the target offset (in arcminutes) if applicable,
    * the defocus (in mm) if applicable,
    * the SIM-Z offset (in mm) if applicable,
    * optional CCDs.

Observer MUST verify that the target coordinates are correct.

***Updated in Cycle 13:*** PLEASE REVIEW THIS SECTION

RESPONSE TO USINT SUPPORT: As Chandra ages, the thermal constraints on
scheduling observations increase. Observations that are approved for
flight without constraints can be pulled into a schedule at
anytime. Please help our planning team by PROMPTLY responding to
your USINT contact to confirm or change parameters as this will ensure
that your observation is approved for flight as soon as possible. This
allows our planning team to have a large pool of observations to
schedule (and you might get your observations completed sooner!).


AIMPOINT: A recent shift in the Chandra aimpoint was documented in
Chandra bulletin 75:

http://cxc.harvard.edu/announcements/announce_75.html

The main concern is that a target could cross a CCD node.  We have
updated the OCAT offsets to mitigate against this possibility. The
astrometry and pointing remain excellent.  Astrometrically, the 90%
error radius is about 0.6" and the 99% error radius is about 1.0".
As a reminder, when working with sub arrays or near the chip edges,
the total pointing budget is about 20" (including absolute pointing,
known thermal shifts in the guide camera, dither, the size of the
"event island" and background).


OPTIONAL CCD POLICY: As of Cycle 13, observers should review their CCD selections
carefully and select 5 or fewer CCDs if the science objectives can
be achieved with 5 or fewer CCDs.  Using 5 or fewer CCDs is beneficial
in keeping the ACIS focal plane (FP) and electronics temperatures within
the desired operating ranges. The observer should ONLY SPECIFY 6 CCDs
if the science objectives REQUIRE 6 CCDs. This is a change from the
previous recommendation of the CXC to use as many CCDs as possible to
allow serendipitous science. At this point in the mission, it is more
important to use fewer CCDs to keep the FP and electronics cooler.
The observer may specify that a given CCD must be on for an
observation by entering "Y" for that CCD, must be off by entering "N",
or that the CCD may be on depending on the predicted thermal
environment by specifying a rank-ordering of optional CCDs by
entering "OPT1-OPT5". The CCD specified as "OPT1" would be the first
optional CCD to be turned off if necessary.  The CCD specified as
"OPT5" would be the last optional CCD to be turned off if necessary.
At this point in the mission, the CXC has only turned off one optional
CCD based on the thermal predictions. If the optimal spectral response provided by a
cold and stable FP temperature is important to the observer, the
observer should select 4 or fewer CCDs to be on by entering "Y" and 6
or more CCDs to be off by entering "N". If the optimal spectral
response is not important for the science objectives, the observer may
specify that 4 CCDs must be on by entering "Y", 1 CCD may be on by
entering "OPT1", and 5 CCDs must be off be entering "N".  GOs are
still encouraged to specify one or more optional CCDs if 5 total
(required+optional) CCDs are requested for an observation.  GOs are
discouraged from specifying 5 CCDs as required and one CCD as optional.
Starting in Cycle 13, the CXC may decide to turn off an optional CCD if
6 CCDs total are requested (where total is the sum of required and
optional CCDs) for observations that are scheduled at a pitch angle
larger than 130 degrees. If you have difficulty in assessing the best
CCDs to select as optional, please contact your Uplink Support person.

GOs may still require that 6 CCDs be on for their observation,
but this may require that the observation be scheduled at a different
time during which the thermal environment is more favorable or
that the observation be split into multiple pieces.  In general, GOs
should specify 5 or fewer CCDs unless the science objectives require 6 CCDs.

For observations using the VF mode, observers should take note that as
the Solar activity is close to the peak for Solar Cycle 24, the Chandra
background rates are decreasing. This means that the risk of telemetry
saturation is decreasing. It is suggested to use a background count
rate of ~36 cts/s for 6 CCDs and ~30 cts/s for 5 CCDs using an energy
filter of 0.1-12.1 keV (specified in RPS parameters as
energy filter lower=0.1 keV and energy filter range=12.0keV) to
compare to the telemetry saturation limit of 68 cts/s in VF mode.
If no energy filter is specified, a filter from 0.1 to 13.1 keV will
be used by default. Please refer to the POG or contact your USINT
personnel for estimating your risk of telemetry saturation.

If the observer selects a subarray, they should read section 6.12 of
the Proposers Observatory Guide:

http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html#tth_sEc6.12

to fully understand how the selection of the number of operational CCDs
and the size of the subarray affects the minimum frametime.  In
general, using fewer CCDs will permit a faster readout.  For example,
using the smallest subarray of 128 rows in the middle of the CCD with
1 CCD has a minimum frametime of 0.4s and with 6 CCDs has a minimum
frametime of 0.7s.  In almost all cases, the observer should leave the
parameter on the RPS target form that asks if the most efficient
frametime should be used to the default value of "Y".  This parameter
should only be changed if the observer fully understands the impact on
the efficiency of their observation and if they have discussed the


***End of updated for cycle 13***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should have already been contacted by the Chandra Director's office
concerning the key parameters:
Instrument Grating Coordinates    Optional Chips    Preferences    Constraints


Comments given to CDO during this contact have been transferred to
USINT --
but DO NOT ASSUME USINT IS COMPLETELY AWARE OF THEM UNTIL YOU HAVE
CONFIRMATION FROM YOUR CONTACT.

Due to the thermal budget of the orbit worked into the long term schedule,
new preferences and constraints are very difficult to accommodate at this time.
If the situation is dire or has a very strong science driver we can contact the
director's office on your behalf.


SPLIT OBSIDS
Due to the thermal budget of each orbit, some obsids are split into
multiple obsids during the 32 days leading up to the observation. The
policy is that when an approved observation is split, both ends are
approved so long as they are being done in the same week or are pool
targets. Observers will only be notified if both portions of the split
do not end up in the same week and the target was not a pool target.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Important issues to consider:
NUMBER OF CCDs:

As stated above, using 5 or fewer CCDs is beneficial in reducing the
temperatures of the focal plane and electronics. GOs should only
specify 6 CCDs if the science objectives require 6 CCDs. If the
optimal spectral response is important to the science objectives, the
GO should consider using 4 or fewer CCDs. If the optimal spectral
response is not necessary, the GO should consider specifying 4 CCDs as
required and one CCD as optional.


SELECTION OF OPTIONAL CCDS

GOs are now required to specify at least one optional CCD when
completing the target forms in RPS at the time of proposal submission.
As stated above GOs are encouraged to specify two or more optional
CCDs and five or fewer total CCDs (where total is the sum of
required+optional CCDs). If the science objectives require 6 CCDs, the
GO should specify five as required and one as optional at the time of
proposal submission. If the proposal is accepted, the GO can then work
with their USINT contact scientist to change the one optional CCD to a
sixth, required CCD.

USE OF OPTIONAL CCDS

The CXC may decide at the point when the detailed schedule is generated
for a week that an optional CCD must be turned off to satisfy thermal
constraints.  The specification of optional CCDs by the GO gives the
CXC the authority to turn off these CCDs without any further contact
with the GO.


IS SENSITIVITY BELOW 1.0 keV IMPORTANT TO YOUR SCIENCE?

It was discovered during Cycle 3 that the low-energy sensitivity of the
ACIS instrument has been decreasing throughout the life of the
mission.  For more detail on this effect, please consult the web page
at:

http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Acis/detailed_info.html#obf_contam

The decrease in efficiency is presumably due to a layer of
contamination on the filters and/or CCDs.  The GO should make use of
the tools referenced on this web page to evaluate the impact of this
decreased sensitivity on their science.

IS ENERGY RESOLUTION CRITICAL TO YOUR SCIENTIFIC GOALS?

Because of radiation damage to the FI devices, their effective energy
resolution has degraded, and is strongly dependent on the distance of
the event from the readout node. Because of the focal plane geometry,
the detected energy resolution is worst near the aim point of the
imaging array, where the mirror performance is best. The performance
of the FI devices is considerably better at -120 C than at -110 C.
The ACIS CCDs have been operated at -120 C since January 2000, but
many spacecraft orientations in recent years have resulted in
observations with FP temperatures warmer than -120 C.  Since December
2010, the CTI correction has included a temperature-dependent correction to
partially account for the strong temperature dependence of the CTI for
the FI CCDs. The temperature dependent correction recovers part of the
performance lost as the temperature varies, but not all of it.  So, if
the optimal spectral response is required, it is still preferable to
have a cold and stable FP temperature for the observation. The CTI
correction is applied by default in the standard processing of the FI
CCD data.

The BI CCDs had small, but significant CTI at launch and the CTI has
increased slowly over the mission. The CTI of the BI CCDs has a much
weaker temperature dependence than the FI CCDs.  Nevertheless, the BI
CCD CTI correction now includes a temperature-dependent correction
that is also applied in the standard processing.

For a general discussion of the ACIS energy resolution the GO is
advised to review the information on the CXC Calibration page:

http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Acis/detailed_info.html

Then select "Energy Resolution" from the menu on the left.

For further improvement in effective energy resolution, you may
consider moving your target closer to the readout nodes on the imaging
array by offset pointing (at the expense of spatial resolution).
Targets  can be imaged closer to the readout nodes on the S-array by a
SIM-Z translation, without compromising image quality.

IS YOUR TARGET AN EXTENDED X-RAY SOURCE?

If your target is spatially extended, and your science depends on the
correct background subtraction, consider the following:

   (1) The back illuminated (BI) devices (S1 and S3) may be affected
by particle background flares. In the past, the BI background rate
(after the standard event screening) was greater than twice the
quiescent rate for up to 30% of the time.  This flare fraction has
declined with time, and is practically zero at present. We do not know
if/when the flares will return. The front illuminated (FI) devices have
always been little affected by flares.  Note that a re-observation
request will be considered only in the most extreme cases (if the
background rate was greater than five times the quiescent
rate for more than half of the exposure).

   (2) The quiescent background rate, after the standard event
screening, is larger by a factor of 1.5-3 for the BI devices compared
to the FI devices  depending upon the bandpass of interest. The
quiescent background rate increased from 2001 until 2010, reached a
peak in 2010 and has declined since 2010. The quiescent background
rate in 2013 is ~25% higher than that in 2001.  It is not clear if the
background rate will continue to decline in 2014, stay about the same,
or increase, as this depends on the Solar cycle.  For more details,
check the relevant section of the calibration web page.

http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Acis/detailed_info.html#background

In choosing the appropriate device, consider the relative target count
rates using the FI and BI chips (the latter have significantly higher
low energy sensitivity), the relative background  rates, the risk of
flares, the spectrum of your source relative to the background
spectrum, and the desired spectral resolution.  If S3 will be the main
chip and the target substantially fills that chip, consider using S1
for background flare detection.


USE OF VERY FAINT MODE

Studies of ACIS background (see
http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Acis/Cal_prods/vfbkgrnd) have shown that for
weak or extended sources a significant reduction of background at low and
high energies may be made by using the information from 5 x 5 pixel
islands, i.e.  Very Faint mode, instead of the Faint mode 3 x 3
island.  This screening results in a 1-2% loss of good events.  CIAO
2.2 and  later provides a tool to utilize the VF mode for screening
background events.  See

http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/why/aciscleanvf.html

Please note that the RMF generation is the same for Very Faint mode
as it is for Faint mode.

It is important to realize that VF mode uses more telemetry; the limit
is ~68 cts/s, which includes the target flux and the full background
from all chips. Check the calibration web page for a discussion of
background flares and the telemetry limit.

http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Acis/detailed_info.html#background

Review section 1.3 of "General discussion of the quiescent and flare
components of the ACIS background".

In order to reduce the total background rate and the likelihood of
telemetry saturation, VF observations should consider using 5 or fewer
CCDs and an energy filter with a 12 keV upper cutoff. If no energy
filter is specified, a filter from 0.1 to 13.1 keV will be used by
default.  If the target is brighter than 5-10 cts/s, one may have to
take more drastic steps, such as turning off more chips or using Faint
mode. The energy filter specified above is even more important if the
S1 & S3 CCDs are used.

The VF mode background screening can amplify the pileup effect.
Therefore,  this mode cannot be used to reduce background in the
region of bright, i.e. piled-up, sources.  However, there is no
intrinsic increase of pileup in the data, and the software can be
applied to selected regions excluding bright sources.

IS YOUR TARGET AN X-RAY POINT SOURCE?

If your target is a point source, be sure you have estimated your
count rate correctly. Take appropriate measures to avoid event pileup
at levels that may compromise your scientific goals.  Because of the
Poisson nature of pileup, its effects can compromise your observations
with even a small event flux per frame.  For example, roughly 4% of
your events will experience pileup for a count rate of 0.1 events per
readout frame.  Pileup can affect both the shape of the PSF and the
observed spectral energy distribution of your source.  See the
calibration webpage for information regarding pileup, and the
Proposers Guide section 6.14, at

http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html#tth_sEc6.14

for steps that can be taken to mitigate the effects of pileup.
The GO is also advised to become familiar with the SW which models the
effect of pileup on the observed spectrum:

http://space.mit.edu/CXC/analysis/davis/head2002/index.html .


HIGH TELEMETRY RATES

Beware of high telemetry rates.  The limiting telemetry rate that
avoids data loss (saturation) is a function of ACIS mode.  Estimate
the count rate of all sources in your field (using the PIMMS software,
for example) and the potential increase in count rate due to
background flares on the BI devices.  If you do not need the BI
device, and you are approaching telemetry saturation, consider turning
off the BI device(s).  See Tables 6.10 and 6.11 in the Proposers'
Guide for telemetry saturation rates for the available ACIS
modes.

OPTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

If your observation does not use gratings, is greater than 30 ks, at a
high Galactic latitude and free of large extended sources, it may be
useful for background calibration and monitoring.  Provided it does
not interfere with your science goals, consider the following:
    (1) Use Very Faint mode, telemetry capacity permitting.  VF is a
superset of Faint mode and all existing calibration products apply
when you use default processing, which only considers the 3 x 3 island
data (i.e., when you do not use the special tool to screen the 5 x 5
island to reduce background).
    (2) If your main chip is S3, consider also using S1 to help background
modeling.


CALIBRATION

Please consult the calibration webpage for additional information.

CHANGES NOT PERMITTED

Be advised, the following changes in your observing program are not
usually permitted:
a) Adding constraints (e.g. roll angle or a time constraint).
b) A change in exposure time or target, or instrument switches that would
deviate from, or be inconsistent with, your proposed scientific goals.
