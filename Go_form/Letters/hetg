Dear Observer,

We are writing to let you know that we will be supporting
the planning of your Chandra HETGS observation.

Some changes to the Chandra instruments since launch as
well as experience with flight data suggest that all HETGS
instrument configurations should be re-examined and possibly changed
slightly in order to enhance the observations' scientific value.

Attachment #1 summarizes some of the most important
changes you may wish to consider.

We want to make sure that the best science is obtained
with the Chandra HETGS.
Please take a look at the attachment and contact us
about specific observation parameters and any adjustments you
want to make. Your HETGS observation parameters, as they now appear
in our observation data base (OBSCAT) can be viewed starting on the
web at 

     http://cxc.harvard.edu/targets

As appropriate, you will also find links so you may see the
the HETGS orientation for the roll angle that would be used
given the placement of the observation in the long term schedule.
For further information about the instrument status and calibration
you may want to consult the following web sites:

                Observation Planning Considerations
                  for Chandra HETGS Observations
                          February 1, 2000


OBSERVING SCHEDULES AND TIMESCALES

If your target is in the long term schedule
(http://cxc.harvard.edu/target_lists/longsched.html) information is needed by 
7 weeks in advance. The target will not be scheduled earlier, but
could be scheduled later if necessary due to other demands on the
scheduling process. Note that all time/roll constraints will be
honored. If your target is in sections 49, 50, 51, it means it is
in a pool of observations which have no constraints and are
visible any time. These are used to fill-in the weekly schedules
to increase observing efficiency. Because these can be scheduled
at any time, we request review of the configuration as soon as
possible, so that we might use them. (We regret that there will
inevitably be some of these not done until almost the very end of
the AO cycle).

Events leading up to your observation are summarized briefly
here:      

    Obs - 7 weeks    : Observer contact to review his observation 
    Obs - 3 weeks    : Notification of observation in OR list
    Obs + few days   : Notification of completion of observation

Note, that some time near the Obs - 3 weeks deadline is reserved
for emergency changes only and changes proposed after that
deadline have good  probablility to be rejected. Therefore please
contact us NEAR the Obs - 7 weeks period. Also, please allow for
possible delays for the notification of completion.

ACIS RELATED ISSUES

1) Radiative degradation of FI devices:
Because of radiation damage to the FI devices, their detectable 
energy resolution has degraded, and is strongly dependent on the
distance of the event from the readout node. Because of the
focal plane geometry, the detected energy resolution is worst near the
aim point of the imaging array where the mirror performance is
best. We expect the performance of the FI devices to improve
when we cool the focal plane to -120 C or below (currently
targeted for February 2000). 

2) Background:
The quiescent background flux is larger for the BI
devices compared to the FI devices for ACIS grades 02346
between 0.3--10 keV, and background flares
with amplitudes of 5-50 times the quiescent rate occur
over roughly 30% of a moderate to long observation (>20 ksec). 
The background flares are usually not seen when the HETG is inserted
but are seen when the LETG is inserted.

3) Telemetry:
Be aware of telemetry rates.  The limiting telemetry rate that
avoids data loss (dropout) is a function of ACIS mode. Estimate
the count rate of all sources in your field and the potential
increase in count rate due to background flares on the BI
devices. If you do not need the 0th order image in the S3 BI
device and you are approaching telemetry saturation, consider
blocking the 0th order with a custom window (pref. 150x150
pixels).  We are recommending the use of TE/F not TE/VF in
almost all cases, given the cosmic ray and particle background
rates. For currently valid limits see Table 5.5 in October 1997
AXAF Proposers' Guide for telemetry saturation rates.

4) Front End Processor 0 (FEP0)
During the early phase of the mission, an intermittent problem was
discovered with one of the Front End Processors (FEPs) which
processes pixel data from the ACIS CCDs.  Specifically, FEP0
would suddenly experience a corruption in the bias map from rows
512 to 1024 at an indeterminate point in the observation.  This
would lead to many spurious events being reported from the top
half of that CCD for the remainder of the observation, flooding
the telemetry stream.

A patch has been developed and installed which detects when such
an error has occurred and prevents data from the top half of the
CCD from being telemetered from that point in the observation. 
GOs should be aware that they might see the event data from the
top half of one CCD suddenly stop during an observation sue to
this effect. The error is intermittent and appears to occur only
during long observations (longer than 40 ks).  FEP0 should
therefore be assigned to the CCD which produces the least useful
data in its upper half of rows for an observation.  By default,
FEP0 will be assigned to the S0 CCD when CCDs S0 through S5 are
in use. The GO may request that FEP0 be assigned to a CCD other
than the defaults but there must be a compelling scientific
reason to do so.

HETG RELATED ISSUES

There are a few issues specific to the observations with the
High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG).  These derive primarily
from the dispersion pattern that is unique to the HETG.

1) Although the FI CCD energy resolution has not yet degraded
sufficiently to cause concern for discriminating between orders
in the dispersed spectra, it is still advisable to set up the
observation in order to minimize the impact of this change.
The main reason is that smaller pulse height windows may be used
in the data analysis so that background can be reduced.  This
step is particularly important when the source is faint.  For
point sources, we suggest moving the location of the 0th order
on the S3 array along the readout direction using the Science
Instrument Module (SIM).  A SIM motion of 3 mm will give not
compromise the science of any observation, there will still be
about 100 pixels before the end of the array for a spatial
background region; there is an allowance for an initial
acquisition error of 30\" as well as the +/- 16\" dither pattern.

The user may wish to increase this shift in order to improve
background rejection if the target is particularly hard.  The
smallest energy of interest determines the maximum dispersion
distance and, consequently, the maximum height of the dispersion
pattern (along columns).

2) Pulse pileup has been found to cause a greater impact on
dispersed spectra than expected.  The effect is most noticeable
for MEG spectra in the 1-2 keV range where the effective area
photon spectra often peaks.  At a level of about 0.05 photon per
pixel per frame, we have observed a 50% loss of events in the
first order spectrum.  Some of these events can be recovered by
examining the higher order spectra but some events have \"migrated\"
out of the standard grade set, so the standard calibration curves
no longer apply.  See the Proposer's Guide for ways to mitigate
the effect of pileup.

3) There are a few special concerns regarding diffuse sources.
Clearly, one must take the extent of the source into account
when considering possible SIM shifts.  Perhaps less obvious is
the potential difficulty of combining spectra when two or more
roll angles are used.  Observers may wish to specify that long
observations are not split into pieces because the optimization
of observatory constraints would normally decouple the roll angles
of the pieces.  Finally, it should be noted that if the observer
has a choice of which CCD to connect to FEP0 (and thereby risk
data loss), then we recommend against risking S3, where zeroth
order will be obtained.  The information in zeroth order is
complementary to that of the dispersed images and may well be
necessary for unambiguously differentiating spatial from spectral
variations.

PARAMETER CROSS REFERENCE LIST

The following is a list of the key parameters
which may be considered in optimizing an HETGS observation with
reference to specific issues described in detail above.

SI Mode            - This code for ACIS is determined by the ACIS
                     parameters selected and may be identical
                     to previously used ACIS SI Modes.

Offset Y           - Used to offset point along the dispersion
                     direction to fine tune chip-gap locations, etc.

Offset Z           - generally preferable to use \"Z-Sim\" instead of
                     \"Offset Z\".

Z-Sim              - Useful to move aim point on ACIS-S array closer
                     to framestore area to reduce FI CTI effects.

ACIS Exposure Mode - TE or CC selection: useful for pileup reduction.

Event TM Format    - For telemetry reasons, generally
                     recommend \"Faint\" instead of \"Very Faint\";
                     \"Graded\" only if required by telemetry rate.

Frame Time         - Generally 3.2 sec for HETGS; may be reduced for
                     pileup reduction and/or consider CC mode.

Standard Chips     - \"N\" for ACIS-S array operation.

I0 - I3            - \"N\" for ACIS-S array operation.

S0 - S5            - \"Y\" for ACIS-S array operation.

Subarry Type       - Generally \"None\" for HETGS observations.

Duty Cycle         - For use in Alternating Frame mode.  This
Number               mode must be selected and used with care.
Tprimary             
Tsecondary

Event Filter      - Events may be vetoed from the telemetry based
Lower               on energy.  This may be useful for telemetry
Range               reduction on e.g., known-to-be-cutoff sources.

Window Filter     - Spatial window parameters may be useful for
Start Row           reducing telemetry rate on a bright source;
Start Column        note that \"sample rate\" allows some events
Height              to be telemtered, e.g., from zero-order region.
