Updating letter generator for new AO (usually done in Sep/Oct each
year):

e.g. for cycle 15

cp AO14.html AO15.html

edit AO15.html changing cycle 14 references to cycle 15

cp cycle14.cgi cycle15.cgi

edit cycle15.cgi:

     *make any changes that people want to the text of the ACIS, HRC,
      and LETG letters.  (Note:  HETG letter is not used, can ignore.)
      HRC letter is reviewed by Vinay Kashyap and Mike Juda.  LETG
      letter is reviewed by Brad Wargelin and Jeremy Drake.  ACIS
      letter is usually reviewed by Scott Wolk, Paul Plucinksy, and
      Dan Schwartz.

     *change 14 to 15 in this line: print "<form action=\"cycle14.cgi\">\n";
      
go to AO15.html page and test form.  Also make sure that links in
letters are still valid.  

If everything looks good, point index.html to AO15.html.

If there is a new USINT person, or if a USINT's contact information
has changed, edit cxc_data.txt .
